    <h1>1. Define Hoisting</h1>
        <p>Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

        Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
        
        Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.</p>
        
    <p>//ReferenceError :-</p>
            <pre>   Person = "John";
    let Person;</pre>
    <p>//Syntax Error :-</p>
    <p>Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run</p>
    <pre>       Person = "John";
        const Person;</pre>

    <h1>2. Temperal Dead Zone</h1>
    <p>It is a behaviour that happens in JavaScript while declaring variable before initializing the variable.</p>
    <p>Time gap between this is called Temperal Dead Zone</p>
